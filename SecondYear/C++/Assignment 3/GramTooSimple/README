It also contains a far-too-simple show method.

The code can be compiled though with

 g++ Rule.cpp rule_tester.cpp -o myprog

where tester.cpp causes a Rule to be made, and causes its show() method to be run. It does not
really do anything with the string that is passed to the constructor, with exactly that being
just displayed. 

The exercise in the notes relating to this requires

 o the Rule class to have members for the mother and daughter parts of a rule,

 o the constructor to be correspondingly more complex, containing the
   same kind of string and vector that was in the 'rule_parsing.cpp'
   code discussed in 'Example using string and vector.

 o the show method also to refer to separate mother and daugther parts of the Rule object

The exercise also requires the implementation of Grammar class using Rule appropriately.

Grammar.h and Grammar.cpp give a minimal start in the direction of that.
